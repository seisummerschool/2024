                    Andrew Butterfield is an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science and Statistics, at Trinity College Dublin, where he is also Head of the Software Foundations and Verification research group. His early research was in the use of functional languages as a way to improve hardware designs. He then switched his research focus to formal semantics with a strong focus on input-output in pure functional languages and the semantics close to the software/hardware divide. This has included semantics for hardware compilation, probabilistic systems and shred-variable concurrency. He is active in the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) community, and has also developed tools that support the development of UTP theories. Recent work has focused on formalising operating systems for space craft. He was a co-founder of the Irish Formal Methods Special Interest group, has chaired international conferences in functional programming and UTP. He has been funded by Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the European Space Agency

                <h5>Developing and Applying Unifying Theories of Programming</h5>
                <p>
                    The course will cover UTP, both theory and tools that assist in theory developments. It will also explore how UTP may help to create a formal bridge that spans from Promela models to test code generated from those models.

                    Dr. Jun Pang is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) at the University of Luxembourg. Dr. Jun Pang received the PhD degree in computer science from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2004. His research interests include formal methods, security and privacy, graph machine learning, complex networks, and computational systems biology.

                <h5>Modelling and Analysis of Complex Networks</h5>
                <p>
                    Networks are a fundamental concept for modelling complex physical, technological, social, and biological systems. The course will cover several fundamental aspects of networks: network models, methods for describing network structure and measuring networks, community detection, in complex networks. More advanced topics, such as network embedding and graph neural networks (GNNs) and their applications, will be also introduced and discussed. With the course, students will learn how to explore computational algorithms and machine learning techniques to reveal insights of real-world networks.

                    <img src="imgT/sunjun.png" class="photo" width="200px" height="130px"/>
                    SUN, Jun is currently a professor at Singapore Management University (SMU). He received Bachelor and PhD degrees in computing science from National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2002 and 2006. He has been a faculty member since 2010. He has received the prestigious LEE KUAN YEW fellowship twice in 2007 and 2022. Jun's research interests include formal methods, program analysis and lately AI security. He is the co-founder of the PAT model checker. To this date, he has more than 250 journal articles or peer-reviewed conference papers, many of which are published at top-tier venues.

                <h5>Towards AI Safety</h5>
                <p>AI security (e.g., the fairness of neural networks, whether they are robust or have backdoors) is crucial in a variety of security-critical applications. In this series of lectures, I will systematically present recent research on neural network security, including how to evaluate whether a neural network is robust, fair, or has backdoors, and systematically fix potentially faulty neural networks, with the ultimate goal of certifying the security of neural networks. We will use various formal and informal methods.
